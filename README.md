## What the project does?
### Storyboard
The problem we are trying to solve with AR Meow Meow is “the desire for more social interaction that people who may be lonely and are unable to interact with others in these trying times have, and simultaneously, the desire for cat lovers who want to keep a cat but are unable to due to whatever circumstances”.
