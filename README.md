# AR Meow Meow
AR Meow Meow is a mobile Augmented Reality game that can let users raise virtual cats on their smartphone through feeding, playing, and completing tasks anywhere, anytime. Meow o(-w-)o

## Why the project is useful?
AR Meow Meow is a simple and adorable game for helping people relax themselves in daily life.

The problem we are trying to solve with AR Meow Meow is “the desire for more social interaction that people who may be lonely and are unable to interact with others in these trying times have, and simultaneously, the desire for cat lovers who want to keep a cat but are unable to due to whatever circumstances”.

Our goal is to make a mobile Augmented Reality game that can let users raise virtual cats on their smartphone. We want to let users play with their virtual cats such as feeding and greeting at anywhere, anytime. Meanwhile, we also want to realize and encourage interactions between different users by letting them socialize with other cat lovers using our app.  

## What the project does?
### Storyboard
We realized that some cat lovers might not be able to raise real cats at their home, and due to the special situation this year, we know many people need more social interaction. We want to take these into consideration and design an AR app to solve the problems. The app will allow users to raise virtual cats, decorate their living space, and also let them socialize with other cat lovers.

### List of Features
Users can enjoy the experience of raising virtual cats with complete storyline in AR mode, and can also collaborate with other users to play with cats together in a shared VR clubroom.

#### AR Features
- **Custom storyline & multiple endings:** We designed a complete storyline with multiple possible endings for each cat. (TODO)

- **Random generation of cat appearance, age, background:** A cat of random color, age and background will be generated in our database when users start the game. The difference of each cat might result in different stories and endings. 
- **Physical environment detection to place cats:** Our app is able to search for and detect real-world objects and surfaces though processing camera image in AR session. Therefore, users can place their cat in a "reasonable" position in the real world. 
- **Interaction including feeding, playing and decorating:** Users can feed or play with cats using various types of items, and also decorate their living space by placing different preset furnitures around.
- **Hunger and mood level system:** We designed hunger and mood levels systems which will reflect the status of the cat after each user-cat interaction, and these different levels will cause different outcomes.

- **Currency and shop system:** We also designed a currency and shop system that allows users to purchase new items for cats. The coins can be earned through daily login.
